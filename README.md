# Simple OAuth 2.0 Implementation

This is an open-source project designed to provide a simple implementation of **OAuth 2.0** security concepts. It includes both an **Authorization Server** and an **OAuth Client**, making it easy for developers to understand the flow of authentication and authorization in a secure system.

---

## Features

- **OAuth Authorization Server**:
    - Issues secure access tokens and refresh tokens.
    - Handles token validation.
    - Uses Spring Security for robust security configurations.

- **OAuth Client**:
    - Requests access tokens from the Authorization Server.
    - Uses tokens to access protected resources.
    - Demonstrates secure communication between client and server.

- **Simple and Illustrative**:
    - Focuses on clarity and simplicity for beginners.
    - Can be adapted for practical use cases or as a learning resource.

## Requirements

- Java 23 
- Maven 3.6+
- Spring Boot 3.x
- A modern IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse)

- **Authorization Server**:
    - Configured using Spring Security and OAuth 2.0 libraries.
    - Manages token issuance and validation.

- **OAuth Client**:
    - Requests and uses tokens to access resources.
    - Demonstrates secure interactions with the server.

2. Access the client application through your browser.
3. Authenticate using credentials configured in the Authorization Server.
4. Observe the token exchange and secure communication between client and server.
